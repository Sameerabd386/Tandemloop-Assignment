Tandemloop Technology – Assignment Test 1




Programming Language Used: Python

This assignment contains four programs.

All of them are written in Python.


Below is a simple explanation of what each program does.

Problem 1: Calculator using a Class

This program creates a small calculator using a Python class.
The calculator performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Inputs used:

a (double)

b (double)

type of operation (string)

The program reads the values from the user and then performs the selected operation.




Problem 2: Generate Odd Number Series

Given a single integer as input, the program generates the first “a” odd numbers.

Examples:

Input 1 → Output: 1

Input 2 → Output: 1, 3

Input 3 → Output: 1, 3, 5

The program uses the formula:
2*n - 1
to generate odd numbers.






Problem 3: Generate Odd Numbers with Even/Odd Rule

This problem is similar to Problem 2 but with an additional rule:

If the input number “a” is odd, print the first a odd numbers.

If the input number “a” is even, print the first a - 1 odd numbers.

Examples:

Input 2 → Output: 1

Input 3 → Output: 1, 3, 5

Input 6 → Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

The program checks whether the number is even or odd and then generates the required list.

Problem 4: Count of Multiples in a List

The input list for this problem is:
[1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30]

The task is to count how many numbers in this list are divisible by each number from 1 to 9.

Example output:
{1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}

The program uses loops to check divisibility and stores the counts in a dictionary.
